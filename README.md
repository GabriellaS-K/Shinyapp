# Shinyapp
Hello! Thanks for looking here :) 
I am trying to make a shiny app, or rather improve it. 

I have an app built at the moment to show boxplots of 4 different time points, for different experimental data. I would like to add a fourth dataset to this, however the way I'm writing it is really long. There must be a better way! The aim is to have a drop down list/buttons to select different markers from the four datasets, and show boxplots of each marker at 4 time points. Open to suggestions on how to make it look nicer in the app. I'll stick to boxplots for now though. 

Under the 'data' folder you will find the .rds of the four datasets. 
The rmd file 'Createdata' shows how I made this data, though you do not need to run it to make this work. It is just background.
